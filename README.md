## Introduction

### Shahir Ahmed and Megan Triplett

Peer-to-Playlist is a real-time social networking application that matches users based on their shared music preferences. The system leverages Spotify's API to analyze users' music tastes and create meaningful connections, combined with a robust messaging system that incorporates multimedia sharing and real-time notifications.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture and workflows that power the application, from authentication and matching algorithms to real-time messaging and file handling.

        Spotify_API[Spotify Web API]
    end

    Hooks --> Socket_Client

    API_Client --> API_Server
    Socket_Client --> Socket_Server

    API_Server --> Auth
    API_Server --> Spotify_Integration
    API_Server --> Match_Engine
    API_Server --> Message_Controller

    Message_Controller --> MongoDB
    Message_Controller --> Socket_Server
    Upload_Service --> AWS_S3
    Upload_Service --> Cloudinary
    Socket_Server --> MongoDB
```

## Core Technologies

The application is built using the following core technologies:

**Frontend:**

- React.js for UI components
- Zustand for state management
- Socket.IO Client for real-time communication
- Axios for HTTP requests
- TailwindCSS for styling

**Backend:**

- Node.js with Express for the API server
- JWT for authentication
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling
- AWS SDK for S3 integration
- Cloudinary SDK for media handling
- Spotify Web API Node for Spotify integration

**Databases & Storage:**

- MongoDB for user data, matches, and messages
- AWS S3 for document storage
- Cloudinary for media storage and optimization

## Authentication Workflows

### Login Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant AuthController
    participant JWT
    participant MongoDB

    User->>Frontend: Enter email/password
    Frontend->>AuthController: POST /api/auth/login
    AuthController->>MongoDB: Find user by email
    MongoDB-->>AuthController: Return user (with hashed password)
    AuthController->>AuthController: Verify password with bcrypt
    AuthController->>JWT: Generate JWT token
    JWT-->>AuthController: JWT token
    AuthController->>Frontend: Set HTTP-only cookie with JWT<br/>Return user object
    Frontend->>Frontend: Initialize Socket.IO connection<br/>Store user in Zustand state
    Frontend-->>User: Redirect to main app
```

The login flow authenticates users and establishes a secure session:

1. User submits login credentials through the frontend
2. Backend verifies credentials against the MongoDB database
3. If valid, the server:
   - Generates a JWT token with a 7-day expiration
   - Sets the token as an HTTP-only cookie (preventing client-side JavaScript access)
   - Returns user data (excluding password)
4. Frontend:
   - Initializes a Socket.IO connection with the user's ID for real-time features
   - Updates global state with user information
   - Redirects to the main application interface

### Signup Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant AuthController
    participant SpotifyController
    participant JWT
    participant MongoDB
    participant Cloudinary
    participant SocketServer

    User->>Frontend: Fill signup form<br/>(optionally connect Spotify)

    alt With Spotify Connection
        Frontend->>SpotifyController: GET /api/auth/spotify/login
        SpotifyController-->>Frontend: Spotify authorization URL
        Frontend->>Spotify: Open popup with auth URL
        Spotify->>User: Request permissions
        User->>Spotify: Grant permissions
        Spotify->>SpotifyController: Redirect with auth code
        SpotifyController->>Spotify: Exchange code for tokens
        Spotify-->>SpotifyController: Access & refresh tokens
        SpotifyController->>Frontend: Send tokens via postMessage
    end

    Frontend->>AuthController: POST /api/auth/signup with user data<br/>(+ Spotify tokens if connected)

    alt If profile image uploaded
        AuthController->>Cloudinary: Upload image
        Cloudinary-->>AuthController: Image URL
    end

    alt If Spotify connected
        AuthController->>Spotify: Fetch profile data<br/>(top artists, tracks, etc.)
    end

    AuthController->>MongoDB: Create new user document
    AuthController->>JWT: Generate JWT token
    JWT-->>AuthController: JWT token
    AuthController->>Frontend: Set HTTP-only cookie with JWT<br/>Return user object
    AuthController->>SocketServer: Emit "newUserProfile" event
    Frontend->>Frontend: Initialize Socket.IO connection<br/>Store user in Zustand state
    Frontend-->>User: Redirect to main app
```

The signup flow registers new users and optionally connects their Spotify account:

1. User completes the signup form with required fields (name, email, password, age) and can choose to connect their Spotify account
2. If connecting Spotify:
   - Backend generates a Spotify authorization URL with required scopes
   - Frontend opens a popup for the user to authenticate with Spotify
   - Spotify redirects back with an authorization code
   - Backend exchanges the code for access and refresh tokens
   - Frontend receives tokens via postMessage
3. Frontend sends user data and Spotify tokens to the backend
4. If a profile image is provided, it's uploaded to Cloudinary
5. If Spotify is connected, the server:
   - Creates a Spotify client with the tokens
   - Fetches user's profile, top artists, top tracks, saved tracks, and followed artists
   - Stores this data in the user object
6. Backend creates a new user in MongoDB
7. Server emits a "newUserProfile" event to all connected clients
8. Backend generates a JWT token and sets it as an HTTP-only cookie
9. Frontend initializes Socket.IO and updates global state

### Session Management

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Frontend
    participant AuthMiddleware
    participant JWT
    participant MongoDB

    Frontend->>AuthMiddleware: Request to protected route<br/>with JWT cookie
    AuthMiddleware->>JWT: Verify token

    alt Valid Token
        JWT-->>AuthMiddleware: Decoded user ID
        AuthMiddleware->>MongoDB: Find user by ID
        MongoDB-->>AuthMiddleware: User data
        AuthMiddleware->>AuthMiddleware: Attach user to request
        AuthMiddleware-->>Frontend: Allow access to protected resource
    else Invalid/Expired Token
        JWT-->>AuthMiddleware: Verification failed
        AuthMiddleware-->>Frontend: 401 Unauthorized
        Frontend->>Frontend: Redirect to login
    end
```

Session management ensures that only authenticated users can access protected resources:

1. When the frontend makes requests to protected routes, the JWT cookie is automatically included
2. The `protectedRoute` middleware:
   - Extracts the JWT token from cookies
   - Verifies the token using the JWT_SECRET
   - Retrieves the user's ID from the decoded token
   - Fetches the user from MongoDB
   - Attaches the user object to the request for downstream handlers
3. If the token is invalid or expired, the server responds with a 401 Unauthorized status
4. The frontend redirects to the login page on authentication failures

On application load, the frontend checks the current authentication status by making a request to `/api/auth/me` which is protected by the same middleware.

### Spotify Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant SpotifyController
    participant SpotifyAPI
    participant UserModel

    User->>Frontend: Click "Connect Spotify"
    Frontend->>SpotifyController: GET /api/auth/spotify/login
    SpotifyController->>SpotifyController: Generate state parameter
    SpotifyController->>SpotifyController: Store state in pendingStates set
    SpotifyController->>SpotifyAPI: Create authorization URL with scopes
    SpotifyController-->>Frontend: Return Spotify auth URL
    Frontend->>Frontend: Open popup window with auth URL

    User->>SpotifyAPI: Authorize application
    SpotifyAPI->>SpotifyController: Redirect to callback with code & state
    SpotifyController->>SpotifyController: Verify state parameter
    SpotifyController->>SpotifyAPI: Exchange code for tokens
    SpotifyAPI-->>SpotifyController: Access token, refresh token, expiration

    SpotifyController->>Frontend: Send tokens via postMessage
    Frontend->>Frontend: Close popup
    Frontend->>Frontend: Store tokens in form data or update user

    alt During Signup
        Frontend->>Frontend: Include tokens in signup data
    else Updating Existing Profile
        Frontend->>Backend: Update user with Spotify data
        Backend->>SpotifyAPI: Fetch user profile data
        Backend->>UserModel: Update user's Spotify information
    end
```

The Spotify authentication flow securely connects users' Spotify accounts:

1. User initiates the process by clicking "Connect Spotify"
2. Backend:
   - Generates a random state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks
   - Creates a Spotify authorization URL with required scopes
   - Returns the URL to the frontend
3. Frontend opens a popup with the authorization URL
4. User authenticates with Spotify and grants permissions
5. Spotify redirects to the callback endpoint with an authorization code and state parameter
6. Backend:
   - Verifies the state parameter matches a pending request
   - Exchanges the code for access and refresh tokens
   - Returns tokens to the frontend via postMessage
7. Frontend closes the popup and either:
   - Includes the tokens in the signup form data, or
   - Sends the tokens to update an existing user's profile
8. Backend fetches the user's Spotify data and stores it in the database

The required Spotify scopes include:

- user-read-private
- user-read-email
- user-top-read
- user-library-read
- user-follow-read

## Matching System Workflows

### Profile Scoring Algorithm

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Scoring Algorithm"
        input[User Profile Data]
        process[Score Calculation]
        output[Compatibility Scores]

        subgraph "Weighted Factors"
            artists[Top Artists: x3 Weight]
            tracks[Top Tracks: x2 Weight]
            saved[Saved Tracks: x1 Weight]
            followed[Followed Artists: x1 Weight]
        end

        input --> process
        process --> artists
        process --> tracks
        process --> saved
        process --> followed
        artists --> output
        tracks --> output
        saved --> output
        followed --> output
    end
```

The matching algorithm calculates compatibility scores between users based on their Spotify data:

1. For each potential match, the system compares:
   - Common top artists (weight: 3)
   - Common top tracks (weight: 2)
   - Common saved tracks (weight: 1)
   - Common followed artists (weight: 1)
2. Score calculation: `score = (commonArtists.length * 3) + (commonTracks.length * 2) + (commonSaved.length * 1) + (commonFollowed.length * 1)`
3. Users are then sorted by score in descending order
4. Each matching element (artist, track) is enhanced with human-readable names fetched from Spotify

The scoring mechanism prioritizes taste in artists above individual tracks, creating more meaningful connections based on broader musical preferences.

### User Discovery Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Frontend
    participant MatchController
    participant UserModel
    participant SpotifyClient
    participant SpotifyCache

    Frontend->>MatchController: GET /api/matches/user-profiles
    MatchController->>UserModel: Find current user
    UserModel-->>MatchController: Current user data

    MatchController->>SpotifyClient: Create Spotify client with user tokens
    MatchController->>UserModel: Find all users NOT in exclusion list
    Note right of MatchController: Exclusion list contains:<br/>- Current user<br/>- Already liked users<br/>- Already disliked users<br/>- Already matched users

    UserModel-->>MatchController: Candidate user profiles

    loop For each candidate
        MatchController->>MatchController: Calculate overlap between current user and candidate
        MatchController->>MatchController: Compute match score based on weighted factors
        MatchController->>SpotifyCache: Add artist/track IDs for batch name lookup
    end

    MatchController->>SpotifyClient: Batch fetch artist names
    SpotifyClient-->>MatchController: Artist name mapping
    MatchController->>SpotifyClient: Batch fetch track names
    SpotifyClient-->>MatchController: Track name mapping

    MatchController->>MatchController: Sort candidates by score descending
    MatchController->>MatchController: Format response with scores and common items
    MatchController-->>Frontend: Return sorted user profiles with match data
```

The user discovery flow presents potential matches to users:

1. Frontend requests potential profiles from the backend
2. Backend:
   - Retrieves the current user's data
   - Creates an exclusion list containing: the current user, users already liked/disliked, and existing matches
   - Queries the database for all users not in the exclusion list
   - Creates a Spotify client using the current user's tokens
3. For each potential match, the system:
   - Calculates overlap between profiles (common artists, tracks, etc.)
   - Computes a match score using the weighted algorithm
   - Tracks artist and track IDs for batch name lookups
4. Backend performs batch queries to Spotify to retrieve human-readable names
5. Results are sorted by compatibility score and returned to the frontend
6. Frontend displays potential matches, highlighting common musical interests

This approach minimizes API calls by batching Spotify requests and using an in-memory cache for artist and track names.

### Swiping Mechanics

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant MatchController
    participant UserModel
    participant SocketServer

    alt Swipe Right (Like)
        User->>Frontend: Swipe right on profile
        Frontend->>MatchController: POST /api/matches/swipe-right/:likedUserId
        MatchController->>UserModel: Find current user
        UserModel-->>MatchController: Current user data
        MatchController->>UserModel: Find liked user
        UserModel-->>MatchController: Liked user data

        MatchController->>MatchController: Add likedUserId to current user's likes
        MatchController->>UserModel: Save current user

        alt If mutual like (match)
            MatchController->>MatchController: Add users to each other's matches array
            MatchController->>UserModel: Save both users

            MatchController->>SocketServer: Get connected users map

            alt If liked user is online
                SocketServer->>SocketServer: Send "newMatch" event to liked user
            end

            alt If current user is online
                SocketServer->>SocketServer: Send "newMatch" event to current user
            end
        end

        MatchController-->>Frontend: Return updated user data
        Frontend-->>User: Show "Liked" feedback
    else Swipe Left (Dislike)
        User->>Frontend: Swipe left on profile
        Frontend->>MatchController: POST /api/matches/swipe-left/:dislikedUserId
        MatchController->>UserModel: Find current user
        UserModel-->>MatchController: Current user data

        MatchController->>MatchController: Add dislikedUserId to current user's dislikes
        MatchController->>UserModel: Save current user

        MatchController-->>Frontend: Return updated user data
        Frontend-->>User: Show "Passed" feedback
    end
```

The swiping mechanics allow users to express interest or disinterest in potential matches:

**Swipe Right (Like):**

1. User swipes right on a profile in the frontend
2. Frontend sends a request to `/api/matches/swipe-right/:likedUserId`
3. Backend:
   - Retrieves current user and liked user data
   - Adds the liked user's ID to the current user's `likes` array
   - Checks if the liked user has already liked the current user
   - If it's a mutual like (match):
     - Adds both users to each other's `matches` array
     - Retrieves the Socket.IO mapping of user IDs to socket IDs
     - Sends real-time "newMatch" events to both users if they're online
4. Frontend displays a "Liked" feedback animation

**Swipe Left (Dislike):**

1. User swipes left on a profile in the frontend
2. Frontend sends a request to `/api/matches/swipe-left/:dislikedUserId`
3. Backend:
   - Retrieves current user data
   - Adds the disliked user's ID to the current user's `dislikes` array
4. Frontend displays a "Passed" feedback animation

This implementation ensures that profiles that have been interacted with don't reappear in the discovery feed.

### Real-time Match Notification

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User1
    participant User2
    participant Frontend1
    participant Frontend2
    participant MatchController
    participant SocketServer
    participant ConnectedUsers

    User1->>Frontend1: Swipe right on User2
    Frontend1->>MatchController: POST /api/matches/swipe-right/:user2Id

    alt User2 previously liked User1
        MatchController->>MatchController: Determine it's a match
        MatchController->>SocketServer: Get connected users
        SocketServer->>ConnectedUsers: Get socket IDs
        ConnectedUsers-->>SocketServer: Return mapping

        alt User2 is online
            SocketServer->>Frontend2: Emit "newMatch" event with User1 data
            Frontend2->>Frontend2: Display toast notification
            Frontend2->>Frontend2: Add to matches list
            Frontend2-->>User2: Show match notification
        end

        alt User1 is online
            SocketServer->>Frontend1: Emit "newMatch" event with User2 data
            Frontend1->>Frontend1: Display toast notification
            Frontend1->>Frontend1: Add to matches list
            Frontend1-->>User1: Show match notification
        end
    end

    MatchController-->>Frontend1: Return updated user data
```

The real-time match notification system alerts users immediately when a match occurs:

1. When a user swipes right and it results in a match, the backend:
   - Retrieves the connected users map from Socket.IO
   - Looks up socket IDs for both users
2. For each online user, the server:
   - Emits a "newMatch" event containing the other user's profile data
   - This includes their ID, name, and profile image
3. On the frontend, when a "newMatch" event is received:
   - A toast notification appears informing the user of the new match
   - The matches list is updated to include the new match
   - The match score and shared music are calculated and displayed

The notification includes just enough information to identify the match without requiring an immediate API call, optimizing the real-time experience.

## Messaging System Workflows

### Message Delivery Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Sender
    participant SenderFrontend
    participant MessageController
    participant MessageModel
    participant SocketServer
    participant ReceiverFrontend
    participant Receiver

    Sender->>SenderFrontend: Type and send message

    SenderFrontend->>SenderFrontend: Optimistically add message to local state
    SenderFrontend->>MessageController: POST /api/messages/send
    Note right of SenderFrontend: Payload includes:<br/>- Content text<br/>- Receiver ID<br/>- Attachments<br/>- Link previews

    MessageController->>MessageModel: Create new message document
    MessageModel-->>MessageController: Saved message with generated ID

    MessageController->>SocketServer: Get connected users
    SocketServer-->>MessageController: Connected users map

    alt Receiver is online
        MessageController->>SocketServer: Emit "newMessage" event to receiver
        SocketServer->>ReceiverFrontend: Deliver message in real-time
        ReceiverFrontend->>ReceiverFrontend: Add message to conversation
        ReceiverFrontend-->>Receiver: Display new message
    end

    MessageController-->>SenderFrontend: Return success response with message
```

The message delivery system combines persistent storage with real-time delivery:

1. Sender types a message and clicks send
2. Frontend:
   - Optimistically adds the message to local state for immediate feedback
   - Sends the message to the backend with content, receiver ID, and any attachments
3. Backend:
   - Creates a new message document in MongoDB
   - Gets the Socket.IO connected users map
   - Checks if the receiver is currently online
   - If online, emits a "newMessage" event to the receiver's socket
4. Receiver's frontend (if online):
   - Receives the message immediately via Socket.IO
   - Adds it to the current conversation state
   - Displays it in the chat interface
5. If the receiver is offline, they'll receive all messages when they next load the conversation

This approach ensures messages are never lost while providing instant delivery when possible.

### Attachments Processing

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant MessageInput
    participant FileHandler
    participant UploadController
    participant S3
    participant Cloudinary
    participant MessageController

    User->>MessageInput: Add attachment

    alt Media File (image/video/audio)
        MessageInput->>FileHandler: Convert to base64
        FileHandler-->>MessageInput: Data URL
        MessageInput->>MessageInput: Add to attachments array

        User->>MessageInput: Send message
        MessageInput->>MessageController: POST with base64 data
        MessageController->>Cloudinary: Upload media
        Cloudinary-->>MessageController: CDN URLs
    else Document (PDF/Office/etc)
        MessageInput->>UploadController: Request presigned URL
        UploadController->>S3: Generate presigned PUT URL
        S3-->>UploadController: Presigned URL and object key
        UploadController-->>MessageInput: URL and key

        MessageInput->>S3: Upload file directly using presigned URL
        S3-->>MessageInput: Upload confirmation

        MessageInput->>MessageInput: Add URL and key to attachments array
        User->>MessageInput: Send message
        MessageInput->>MessageController: POST with attachment metadata
    end

    MessageController->>MessageController: Process and save attachments
    MessageController-->>Frontend: Return saved message with attachment URLs
    Frontend-->>User: Show message with attachment
```

The attachments processing system handles different file types appropriately:

1. User selects a file to attach to a message
2. Frontend determines the file type and categorizes it:
   - **Media files** (images, videos, audio):
     - Converted to base64 data URLs in the browser
     - Sent directly to the backend in the message request
     - Uploaded to Cloudinary by the backend for optimization and CDN delivery
   - **Documents** (PDFs, Office files, etc.):
     - Frontend requests a presigned S3 URL from the backend
     - Backend generates a secure, temporary URL with write permissions
     - Frontend uploads the file directly to S3 using the presigned URL
     - Only the metadata (URL, key, name, extension, category) is sent in the message request
3. The message controller saves all attachment metadata in the message document
4. Frontend displays appropriate previews based on the file type

This approach optimizes for:

- User experience (immediate feedback)
- Security (no direct cloud credentials in frontend)
- Network efficiency (direct-to-cloud uploads for large files)
- Media optimization (using Cloudinary's transformations for media files)

### Link Previews

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant MessageInput
    participant LinkController
    participant LinkPreviewJS
    participant ExternalSite
    participant MessageController
    participant MessageModel

    User->>MessageInput: Type URL in message
    MessageInput->>MessageInput: Extract URLs from message text

    loop For each URL
        MessageInput->>LinkController: POST /api/link-preview
        LinkController->>LinkPreviewJS: Get preview data
        LinkPreviewJS->>ExternalSite: Fetch metadata
        ExternalSite-->>LinkPreviewJS: Return HTML with metadata
        LinkPreviewJS->>LinkController: Extract title, description, image
        LinkController-->>MessageInput: Return preview data
        MessageInput->>MessageInput: Display preview card
    end

    User->>MessageInput: Confirm send with previews
    MessageInput->>MessageController: Send message with URLs to preview
    MessageController->>MessageModel: Save message with link preview URLs
    MessageModel-->>MessageController: Saved message
    MessageController-->>MessageInput: Success response
```

The link preview system enhances messages containing URLs:

1. As a user types, the frontend extracts URLs from the message text
2. For each URL:
   - Frontend requests preview data from the backend
   - Backend uses the link-preview-js library to fetch metadata from the URL
   - Library extracts title, description, image URL, and other metadata
   - Preview data is returned to the frontend
3. Frontend displays a preview card for each link
4. When the message is sent, the URLs to be previewed are included in the payload
5. Backend stores these URLs in the message document
6. When a message with preview URLs is loaded, the frontend fetches the preview data again to display

This approach balances:

- User experience (showing previews before sending)
- Performance (avoiding storing large preview data in the database)
- Privacy (fetching links server-side to avoid leaking user data)

### Common Tracks Integration

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User1
    participant User2
    participant ChatInterface
    participant MatchController
    participant SpotifyApi
    participant SpotifyCache

    User1->>ChatInterface: Open chat with User2
    ChatInterface->>MatchController: GET /api/matches
    MatchController->>MatchController: Find match between users
    MatchController->>MatchController: Extract common tracks

    loop For each common track
        alt Track name in cache
            MatchController->>SpotifyCache: Get track name
            SpotifyCache-->>MatchController: Return cached name
        else Track name not in cache
            MatchController->>SpotifyApi: Batch request track details
            SpotifyApi-->>MatchController: Track details
            MatchController->>SpotifyCache: Cache track names
        end
    end

    MatchController-->>ChatInterface: Return match data with common tracks
    ChatInterface->>ChatInterface: Set up Spotify embedded player
    ChatInterface-->>User1: Display chat with embedded track player

    User1->>ChatInterface: Navigate through common tracks
    ChatInterface-->>User1: Play selected track in embedded player
```

The common tracks integration enhances the messaging experience with shared music:

1. When a user opens a chat with a match, the frontend:
   - Retrieves match data, including common tracks
   - Displays a Spotify embedded player in the chat header
   - Loads the first common track in the player
2. Backend processes:
   - When fetching matches, the system calculates common tracks between users
   - Track IDs are converted to human-readable names using the Spotify API
   - Batch requests minimize API calls and an in-memory cache improves performance
3. User experience:
   - Users can navigate through shared tracks with previous/next buttons
   - Embedded player allows immediate playback of shared music
   - Common tracks serve as conversation starters with suggested messages

This integration creates a unique shared musical experience within the chat, reinforcing the app's core value proposition.

## File Storage Architecture

### S3 Presigned URLs

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Frontend
    participant UploadController
    participant AWS_S3_SDK
    participant S3_Bucket

    Frontend->>UploadController: POST /api/uploads/s3/presign
    Note right of Frontend: Includes filename and MIME type

    UploadController->>UploadController: Generate unique object key<br/>(userId/chat_attachments/timestamp_filename)
    UploadController->>AWS_S3_SDK: Create PutObjectCommand
    AWS_S3_SDK->>AWS_S3_SDK: Generate presigned URL with 60s expiry
    AWS_S3_SDK-->>UploadController: Presigned URL + object key
    UploadController-->>Frontend: Return URL and key

    Frontend->>S3_Bucket: PUT file directly to S3 using presigned URL
    S3_Bucket-->>Frontend: Upload confirmation

    Frontend->>MessageController: Send message with file metadata<br/>(URL, key, name, extension, category)
```

The S3 presigned URL system allows secure direct uploads:

1. Frontend requests a presigned URL from the backend:
   - Request includes the filename and MIME type
   - Backend generates a unique object key including the user ID, timestamp, and filename
   - AWS S3 SDK creates a presigned URL with a short expiration (60 seconds)
   - URL and key are returned to the frontend
2. Frontend uploads the file directly to S3:
   - File is sent directly from the user's browser to S3
   - This bypasses the backend server, avoiding transfer bottlenecks
   - After successful upload, the frontend includes file metadata in the message
3. Security benefits:
   - No AWS credentials exposed to the frontend
   - Limited-time access to write a specific object
   - User-specific path prefixes prevent cross-user access

### Cloudinary Integration

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Frontend
    participant AuthController
    participant MessageController
    participant CloudinarySDK
    participant CloudinaryService

    alt Profile Image Upload
        Frontend->>AuthController: POST /api/auth/signup or /api/users/update<br/>with base64 image
        AuthController->>CloudinarySDK: Upload image
        CloudinarySDK->>CloudinaryService: Process and optimize image
        CloudinaryService-->>CloudinarySDK: Return image details (URL, etc.)
        CloudinarySDK-->>AuthController: Return secure URL
        AuthController->>AuthController: Save URL to user document
        AuthController-->>Frontend: Return user with image URL
    else Message Attachment (Media)
        Frontend->>MessageController: POST /api/messages/send<br/>with base64 media
        MessageController->>CloudinarySDK: Upload media to chat_attachments folder
        CloudinarySDK->>CloudinaryService: Process, optimize, transcode
        CloudinaryService-->>CloudinarySDK: Return media details
        CloudinarySDK-->>MessageController: Return secure URL and public ID
        MessageController->>MessageController: Save media metadata to message
        MessageController-->>Frontend: Return success with media URL
    end
```

Cloudinary handles media files with automatic optimization:

1. Two primary upload paths:
   - **Profile images**: During signup or profile updates
   - **Media attachments**: When sending messages with images, videos, or audio
2. In both cases:
   - Media is sent as base64-encoded data from the frontend
   - Backend uploads to Cloudinary using the SDK
   - Cloudinary automatically:
     - Optimizes images for size and quality
     - Transcodes videos to appropriate formats
     - Generates thumbnails if needed
     - Serves content via its global CDN
3. Backend stores only the resulting URLs and metadata, not the raw files

Cloudinary provides several advantages:

- Automatic media optimization and format conversions
- Built-in responsive images and thumbnails
- Reduced bandwidth and storage requirements
- Global CDN with low latency

### File Viewing & Download System

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant ViewAttachmentModal
    participant UploadController
    participant AWS_S3_SDK
    participant S3_Bucket
    participant ExternalServices

    User->>Frontend: Click attachment
    Frontend->>ViewAttachmentModal: Open with attachment metadata

    alt S3 Document
        ViewAttachmentModal->>UploadController: POST /api/uploads/s3/presign-download
        UploadController->>AWS_S3_SDK: Create GetObjectCommand
        AWS_S3_SDK->>AWS_S3_SDK: Generate presigned URL
        AWS_S3_SDK-->>UploadController: Presigned URL with expiry
        UploadController-->>ViewAttachmentModal: Return temporary URL
        ViewAttachmentModal->>S3_Bucket: GET file using presigned URL
        S3_Bucket-->>ViewAttachmentModal: File data
    else Cloudinary Media
        ViewAttachmentModal->>ViewAttachmentModal: Use Cloudinary URL directly
    end

    alt PDF Document
        ViewAttachmentModal->>ViewAttachmentModal: Render in embedded PDF viewer
    else Office Document
        ViewAttachmentModal->>ExternalServices: Request from Office Online Viewer<br/>with document URL
        ExternalServices-->>ViewAttachmentModal: Embedded viewer
    else Image
        ViewAttachmentModal->>ViewAttachmentModal: Render in image viewer
    else Video/Audio
        ViewAttachmentModal->>ViewAttachmentModal: Render in media player
    else ZIP Archive
        ViewAttachmentModal->>ViewAttachmentModal: Extract and display contents<br/>with JSZip library
    else CSV
        ViewAttachmentModal->>ViewAttachmentModal: Parse and display as table<br/>with PapaParse
    end

    ViewAttachmentModal-->>User: Display file in appropriate viewer

    alt User Downloads File
        User->>ViewAttachmentModal: Click download
        ViewAttachmentModal->>ViewAttachmentModal: Create temporary download link
        ViewAttachmentModal->>User: Browser download prompt
    end
```

The file viewing and download system provides a seamless experience for different file types:

1. When a user clicks an attachment, the ViewAttachmentModal component opens with the file's metadata
2. For S3-stored documents:
   - Frontend requests a presigned download URL from the backend
   - Backend generates a temporary URL with read access (expiring in 60 seconds for most files, 15 minutes for Office files)
   - Frontend fetches the file using the presigned URL
3. For Cloudinary media, the URL is used directly
4. Based on the file type, different viewers are used:
   - **PDFs**: Embedded PDF viewer with navigation controls
   - **Office documents**: Microsoft Office Online Viewer iframe
   - **Images**: Responsive image viewer with zoom
   - **Video/Audio**: HTML5 media player
   - **ZIP archives**: JSZip library extracts and displays the structure
   - **CSV files**: PapaParse library converts to a data table
5. Download functionality:
   - Creates a temporary download link
   - Sets the appropriate filename using the original name
   - Triggers the browser's download mechanism

This approach provides:

- Previews for most common file types without requiring downloads
- Secure, temporary access to files
- Appropriate viewers for different content types
- Easy download option for all file types

## Real-time Communication

### Socket.IO Server Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Express Server"
        HTTP[HTTP Server]
        Express[Express App]
        SocketServer[Socket.IO Server]

        Express --> HTTP
        SocketServer --> HTTP
    end

    subgraph "Socket.IO Components"
        Middleware[Socket Middleware]
        ConnectionMap[Connected Users Map]
        EventHandlers[Event Handlers]

        Middleware --> SocketServer
        ConnectionMap --> SocketServer
        EventHandlers --> SocketServer
    end

    subgraph "Socket Events"
        NewMessage[newMessage Event]
        NewMatch[newMatch Event]
        NewUserProfile[newUserProfile Event]
        Disconnect[disconnect Event]

        NewMessage --> EventHandlers
        NewMatch --> EventHandlers
        NewUserProfile --> EventHandlers
        Disconnect --> EventHandlers
    end

    Client1[User 1 Client] <--> SocketServer
    Client2[User 2 Client] <--> SocketServer
    Client3[User 3 Client] <--> SocketServer
```

The Socket.IO server architecture enables real-time communication:

1. Socket.IO server is attached to the same HTTP server as Express

   - This allows sharing the same port for both HTTP and WebSocket connections
   - Configuration matches the CORS settings of the Express app

2. Socket middleware:

   - Authenticates connections using the userId from the handshake
   - Attaches the userId to the socket instance for later reference
   - Rejects connections without valid user identification

3. Connected users map:

   - Maintains a mapping between user IDs and socket IDs
   - Updated when users connect and disconnect
   - Allows controllers to target specific users for real-time updates

4. Event types:
   - **newMessage**: Sent when a user receives a new message
   - **newMatch**: Sent when a mutual like creates a match
   - **newUserProfile**: Broadcast when a new user joins the platform
   - **disconnect**: Handled when a user disconnects

This architecture provides a foundational layer for real-time features throughout the application.

### Event Subscription Model

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Zustand Store
    participant Socket.IO Client
    participant Socket.IO Server

    User->>Frontend: Log in
    Frontend->>Socket.IO Client: Initialize with user ID
    Socket.IO Client->>Socket.IO Server: Connect with auth data

    Frontend->>Zustand Store: Call store subscription methods

    par Subscribe to matches
        Zustand Store->>Socket.IO Client: Listen for "newMatch" events
        Socket.IO Client-->>Zustand Store: Register event handler
    and Subscribe to messages
        Zustand Store->>Socket.IO Client: Listen for "newMessage" events
        Socket.IO Client-->>Zustand Store: Register event handler
    and Subscribe to new profiles
        Zustand Store->>Socket.IO Client: Listen for "newUserProfile" events
        Socket.IO Client-->>Zustand Store: Register event handler
    end

    Socket.IO Server->>Socket.IO Client: Emit event (e.g., "newMatch")
    Socket.IO Client->>Zustand Store: Trigger registered handler
    Zustand Store->>Zustand Store: Update state
    Zustand Store-->>Frontend: Components re-render with new data
    Frontend-->>User: Display notification/update

    User->>Frontend: Log out
    Frontend->>Zustand Store: Call unsubscribe methods

    par Unsubscribe from all events
        Zustand Store->>Socket.IO Client: Remove "newMatch" listener
        Zustand Store->>Socket.IO Client: Remove "newMessage" listener
        Zustand Store->>Socket.IO Client: Remove "newUserProfile" listener
    end

    Frontend->>Socket.IO Client: Disconnect
    Socket.IO Client->>Socket.IO Server: Disconnect event
```

The event subscription model manages real-time updates through the application:

1. Upon login:

   - Socket.IO client is initialized with the user's ID for authentication
   - Connection is established with the Socket.IO server

2. Frontend subscribes to relevant events through Zustand stores:

   - **useMatchStore.subscribeToNewMatches()**: Listens for match notifications
   - **useMessageStore.subscribeToMessages()**: Listens for new messages
   - **useMatchStore.subscribeToNewUserProfiles()**: Listens for new user events

3. When events occur:

   - Socket.IO client receives the event
   - Zustand store handlers process the data
   - Store updates its state
   - React components re-render with the new data
   - User sees real-time updates

4. Upon logout:
   - Unsubscribe methods remove all event listeners
   - Socket.IO client disconnects from the server

This pattern creates a clean separation between socket management and application state, making the system more maintainable.

### Connection Management

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant BackendAPI
    participant SocketServer
    participant ConnectedUsers

    User->>Frontend: Log in
    Frontend->>BackendAPI: Authentication request
    BackendAPI-->>Frontend: Authentication success

    Frontend->>SocketServer: Connect with user ID
    SocketServer->>SocketServer: Authenticate connection
    SocketServer->>ConnectedUsers: Add user ID â†” socket ID mapping

    Note over Frontend,SocketServer: Real-time communication active

    alt User closes tab/browser
        Frontend->>SocketServer: Disconnection event
        SocketServer->>ConnectedUsers: Remove user from mapping
    else User logs out
        User->>Frontend: Log out action
        Frontend->>BackendAPI: Logout request
        BackendAPI-->>Frontend: Logout success
        Frontend->>SocketServer: Manually disconnect socket
        SocketServer->>ConnectedUsers: Remove user from mapping
    else Session timeout/token expiry
        Frontend->>BackendAPI: Request with expired token
        BackendAPI-->>Frontend: 401 Unauthorized
        Frontend->>Frontend: Clear user data
        Frontend->>SocketServer: Disconnect socket
        SocketServer->>ConnectedUsers: Remove user from mapping
    end
```

Connection management handles the socket lifecycle:

1. Connection establishment:

   - After successful authentication, frontend initializes a socket connection
   - User ID is included in the connection authentication data
   - Server validates the connection and maps the user ID to the socket ID

2. Connection tracking:

   - ConnectedUsers map maintains the current user ID to socket ID mapping
   - This map is used by controllers to target specific users for real-time events
   - Exported functions (getConnectedUsers, getIO) provide access to the socket server and user map

3. Disconnection handling:

   - When a socket disconnects (browser closed, network issue, logout)
   - The user is removed from the ConnectedUsers map
   - This ensures events aren't sent to disconnected sockets

4. Manual disconnection:
   - During logout, the frontend explicitly disconnects the socket
   - This ensures clean state management

This approach ensures that:

- Only authenticated users can establish socket connections
- Real-time events are only sent to online users
- System resources are properly managed

## Data Models

The application uses several key data models to store and manage information:

**User Model:**

- Stores basic user information (name, email, password, age, bio, image)
- Tracks social connections (likes, dislikes, matches)
- Contains Spotify account data and music preferences
- Includes timestamps and password validation methods

**Spotify Data (embedded in User):**

- Stores Spotify authentication tokens and user ID
- Contains arrays of Spotify IDs for music preferences
- Includes expiration time for access token

**Message Model:**

- Represents a single message between users
- References sender and receiver by ObjectId
- Stores message content and associated media/files
- Supports link previews and has timestamps

**Attachment Schema (embedded in Message):**

- Represents a file attached to a message
- Contains metadata about the file (URL, key, name, extension)
- Categorizes files for appropriate rendering
- Used for both S3 and Cloudinary stored files

These models are implemented using Mongoose schemas and are stored in MongoDB.

## API Endpoints

The application exposes the following key API endpoints:

### Authentication Routes

## Implementation Details

### Frontend State Management with Zustand

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Zustand Stores"
        AuthStore[useAuthStore]
        MatchStore[useMatchStore]
        MessageStore[useMessageStore]
    end

    subgraph "Authentication State"
        auth_user[authUser]
        loading[loading]
        checkingAuth[checkingAuth]
        auth_actions[signup/login/logout/checkAuth]

        AuthStore --> auth_user
        AuthStore --> loading
        AuthStore --> checkingAuth
        AuthStore --> auth_actions
    end

    subgraph "Match State"
        matches[matches]
        userProfiles[userProfiles]
        loading_states[loading states]
        swipe_actions[swipeRight/swipeLeft]
        fetch_actions[getMyMatches/getUserProfiles]
        socket_actions[subscribe/unsubscribe]

        MatchStore --> matches
        MatchStore --> userProfiles
        MatchStore --> loading_states
        MatchStore --> swipe_actions
        MatchStore --> fetch_actions
        MatchStore --> socket_actions
    end

    subgraph "Message State"
        messages[messages]
        msg_loading[loading]
        message_actions[sendMessage/getMessages]
        msg_socket_actions[subscribe/unsubscribe]

        MessageStore --> messages
        MessageStore --> msg_loading
        MessageStore --> message_actions
        MessageStore --> msg_socket_actions
    end

    Components --> AuthStore
    Components --> MatchStore
    Components --> MessageStore
```

Zustand provides a lightweight state management solution:

1. **useAuthStore**:

   - Manages user authentication state
   - Handles login, signup, and logout operations
   - Maintains the current user object
   - Initializes and destroys the Socket.IO connection

2. **useMatchStore**:

   - Stores matches and potential profiles
   - Handles swiping actions
   - Manages loading states for UI feedback
   - Subscribes to real-time match notifications

3. **useMessageStore**:
   - Maintains conversation messages
   - Handles sending messages and loading conversations
   - Provides optimistic updates for sent messages
   - Subscribes to real-time message events

Benefits of this approach:

- Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux
- Easy integration with React components
- Simple subscription model
- Clear separation of concerns

### Spotify Integration Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Frontend Integration"
        SpotifyAuth[Spotify Auth Flow]
        SpotifyEmbeds[Spotify Embedded Players]
    end

    subgraph "Backend Integration"
        SpotifyClient[Spotify Web API Client]
        ClientFactory[Spotify Client Factory]
        TokenRefresh[Token Refresh Logic]
    end

    subgraph "User Experience"
        ProfileIntegration[Profile Data Integration]
        MatchMatching[Music-Based Matching]
        InChatPlayback[In-Chat Music Playback]
    end

    SpotifyAuth --> SpotifyClient
    SpotifyClient --> ProfileIntegration
    ProfileIntegration --> MatchMatching
    MatchMatching --> InChatPlayback
    InChatPlayback --> SpotifyEmbeds
    SpotifyClient --> ClientFactory
    ClientFactory --> TokenRefresh
    TokenRefresh --> SpotifyClient
```

The Spotify integration is a core feature of the application:

1. **Authentication Flow**:

   - Popup-based OAuth flow for connecting Spotify accounts
   - Securely exchanges authorization codes for tokens
   - Stores tokens in the user model for future API calls

2. **Client Factory**:

   - Creates authenticated Spotify API clients on demand
   - Automatically handles token refreshing when expired
   - Updates tokens in the database when refreshed

3. **User Experience**:
   - Profile data enrichment with music preferences
   - Match scoring based on musical compatibility
   - Embedded players for shared tracks in conversations
   - Track suggestions to drive conversation

This integration creates the foundation for music-based connections that differentiate the app from general dating platforms.

## System Workflow Integration

The complete system integrates multiple workflows to create a cohesive user experience:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "User Journey"
        Signup --> SpotifyConnect
        SpotifyConnect --> Matching
        Matching --> Conversations
        Conversations --> MediaSharing
    end

    subgraph "Authentication Layer"
        Signup[Signup Process]
        Login[Login Process]
        Session[Session Management]
        SpotifyConnect[Spotify Authentication]
    end

    subgraph "Matching Layer"
        Discovery[User Discovery]
        Scoring[Profile Scoring]
        Swiping[Swipe Mechanics]
        MatchNotification[Match Notifications]
    end

    subgraph "Messaging Layer"
        Conversations[Text Messaging]
        MediaSharing[File Attachments]
        LinkPreviews[Link Enrichment]
        MusicSharing[Music Integration]
    end

    subgraph "Real-time Layer"
        SocketConnection[Socket Connection]
        EventSubscription[Event Subscription]
        Notifications[Real-time Updates]
    end

    subgraph "Storage Layer"
        MongoDB[User & Message Data]
        S3Storage[Document Storage]
        CloudinaryMediaCDN[Media Storage & CDN]
    end

    Login --> Session
    Session --> SocketConnection
    SocketConnection --> EventSubscription
    EventSubscription --> Notifications
    Notifications --> MatchNotification
    Notifications --> Conversations
    Signup --> Session
    Discovery --> Scoring
    Scoring --> Swiping
    Swiping --> MatchNotification
    Conversations --> LinkPreviews
    SpotifyConnect --> Scoring
    MusicSharing --> SpotifyConnect
    MediaSharing --> S3Storage
    MediaSharing --> CloudinaryMediaCDN
    MatchNotification --> MongoDB
    Conversations --> MongoDB
```

This integrated view shows how the different system components work together:

1. **Authentication Layer** establishes user identity and sessions
2. **Matching Layer** connects compatible users based on music taste
3. **Messaging Layer** facilitates communication and sharing
4. **Real-time Layer** provides immediate updates across the platform
5. **Storage Layer** persists data securely and efficiently

The workflow begins with user registration, optionally connecting to Spotify, then progresses through discovery, matching, and conversation phases, with real-time updates throughout the journey.
